# PoliticalBias
Built a tensorflow model to find surface bias and filtered bias in articles by traversing through high-volume sets of word lists and continuously training the PoliticalBias model to label articles as biased toward a particular cause.   Currently working on integrating a News API to update training data for real-time world events.
